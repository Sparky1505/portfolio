        Hi, I’m Jayasurya Pazhani. I’m a software engineer with over 3 years of experience building real-world web applications — everything from clean and responsive frontends to stable backend systems that scale. <br />

I recently finished my Master’s in Software Engineering at Concordia University and I’m actively looking for full-time opportunities in frontend, backend, or full-stack development. I’ve worked across different domains including fintech, ERP systems, and startups, and I really enjoy turning ideas into working software that people can use and trust.
<br /><br />
Some of the tools and technologies I’ve worked with include React, Java, Spring Boot, Python, REST APIs, SQL, Git, and Docker. I’ve also worked in Agile teams, contributed to CI/CD workflows, and collaborated closely with designers, product managers, and backend developers.
